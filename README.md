## 📝 Use Case

ScholarBot solves a real problem: academic content is dense, time-consuming to parse, and hard to search. By combining RAG (for uploaded materials) and live web search (for current information), ScholarBot lets anyone:

- Get instant summaries of uploaded research papers
- Ask specific questions about textbook chapters
- Explore topics with cited, up-to-date web results
- Switch between quick answers (Concise) and deep dives (Detailed)
